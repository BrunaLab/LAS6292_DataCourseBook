# HerbVar Data Sets

The “core” HerbVar dataset was begun in 2017 and closed for contributions prior to submission of our 2023 Science paper. For the core dataset, we prioritized surveys that added phylogenetic and geographic breadth.

Additional data collection _**“add-on projects”**_ have since been added (e.g., data on reproductive damage, data on focal plant families, and data on focal plant species). HerbVar network members are welcome to propose new add-on projects.

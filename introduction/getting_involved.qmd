# Getting involved

All professionally-trained researchers with expertise in plant-herbivore interactions are welcome to join HerbVar as a member. We ask members to read this manual before reaching out about joining. Once you have decided to join, please email Will Wetzel (william.wetzel\@montana.edu) to get the process started.

Members can get involved in the network in three main ways:

1.  Become a **Site PI** by collecting data using one of the HerbVar Protocols. Submit data towards a sampling objective and become a co-author on a publication resulting from that sampling objective.

2.  Join an **existing Working Group** open to new members. Working Groups analyze and publish existing data, design and coordinate of new add-on data collection efforts, and develop educational resources.

3.  Propose a **new Working Group** for a project analyzing existing HerbVar data or a project coordinating a new data collection effort.

This manual explains the process for each of these ways of getting involved.

	abstract = {Clonal growth of plants is attained by a number of morphologically different organs (e.g. stolons, rhizomes, and roots), which are not functionally equivalent. Consequently, these clonal growth organ ({CGO}) types can determine functional traits that are associated with clonality, although little is known about their evolutionary flexibility or the constraining role they play on clonal traits. We investigated the rates of evolutionary change by which individual {CGOs} are acquired and lost using a set of 2652 species of Central European flora. Furthermore, we asked how these individual {CGOs} constrain functionally relevant clonal traits, such as lateral spread, number of offspring, and persistence of connections. We show that plants can easily switch in evolution among individual types of {CGO} and between clonal and nonclonal habits. However, not all these transitions are equally probable. Namely, stem-based clonal growth and root-based clonal growth constitute evolutionarily separate forms of clonal growth. Clonal traits are strongly constrained by individual {CGO} types. Specifically, fast lateral spread is attained by stolons or hypogeogenous rhizomes, and persistent connections are attained by all rhizome types. However, the ease with which clonal organs appear and disappear in evolution implies that plants can overcome these constraints by adjusting their morphologies.},

	abstract = {Several species concepts ({SC}) have been suggested as ways to view species, most of them based on Mayr's Biological {SC}. Recent research has raised the debate on the application of the species concepts to Oncocyclus irises. All the Oncocyclus species are able to produce vital progenies when crossed, thus, according to the Biological {SC}, they are a single biological species. Quantitative morphological characters are continuous among populations and also correlate with environmental conditions, preventing species delimitation according to Phenetic and Ecological {SC}. Genetic studies revealed high genetic diversity within the populations, thus, obscure delimitation by Phylogenetic {SC}. Pollination of the Oncocyclus irises is not species-specific, yet no transitional forms exist on the rare occasions of sympatric/parapatric distribution, roughly supporting delimitation according to the Recognition {SC}. The conclusion is that Oncocyclus populations do not clearly fit into species boundaries according to the relevant species concepts. Oncocyclus irises are distributed along an Ecogeographical Speciation Cline that could lead to one of three patterns of divergence, that is, discrete, ecotonal, or continuous, along the spatial dimension. Nonetheless, the exact variation pattern is not clear because of the patchy distribution. The taxonomic status of the Oncocyclus irises is viewed in light of the evolutionary processes in this highly variable group.},

	abstract = {Many ﬂowering plants exhibit dual reproductive modes, producing both sexual and asexual offspring. The commonest form of asexual reproduction is clonal growth, in which vegetative modules (ramets) are produced by the parental genotype (genet). In plants, sexual and asexual reproduction usually occur simultaneously, and this can lead to allocation trade-offs and antagonism between reproductive modes. Our review considers the ecological and evolutionary consequences of functional interactions between clonal reproduction and pollination and mating. Clonal reproduction is commonly associated with mass ﬂowering, restricted pollen dispersal, and geitonogamous self-pollination, processes that can result in inbreeding depression and pollen discounting. We review evidence for the correlated evolution of clonality and sexual systems, particularly self-incompatibility, and identify several ﬂoral mechanisms that function to reduce mating costs by limiting selﬁng and pollen discounting. We conclude by discussing the loss of sexuality in clonal plants and consider the genetic and environmental basis of sexual dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Iris sect. Oncocyclus species generally occur in small populations or locally scattered over rocky hillsides, steppes, and deserts from the north Caucasus to the eastern Mediterranean. Species of this section are easily recognized by their inflorescences of a single, large, spherical flower and sepals with a dark signal spot and adjacent beard of multicellular hairs. We present here results of the first phylogenetic study of sect. Oncocyclus based on one low-copy nuclear and six plastid markers from 33 of approximately 42 species and infraspecific taxa. Gene trees are congruent and nuclear markers are more potentially parsimony informative than plastid markers. We identify clades that do not correspond to previously described species groups based on size, color, and shape of perianth parts and show that hypotheses of species monophyly are not supported. In general, diversification is greatest along terminal branches suggesting that species diversified in isolation. The Caucasus is suggested as the ancestral area for sect. Oncocyclus and the eastern Mediterranean as an important area of diversification.},

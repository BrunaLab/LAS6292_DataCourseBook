#  HerbVar Glossary

When writing papers using HerbVar data, authors should attempt to use a consistent set of definitions and terms, which can facilitate comparisons of patterns across studies.  If one person’s “among-leaf variation” is the same as another person’s “within-plant variation”, this simple mis-match in terminology will hinder communication.  The constellation of terms related to variance, variability, and variation can also be source of confusion. We have assembled a set of terms that might commonly be used in HerbVar manuscripts and grants. 

<!-- Worth defining these?  -->
<!-- Herbivory -->
<!-- Folivory -->
<!-- Frugivory -->



<!-- EB Observation: some of these appear to be terms, others approaches to quantify those terms. Is that part of this too? defining approaches as well as terminology?    -->


Variability

Variation

Variance

Coefficient of Variation (CV)

Gini Coefficient

Skewness

Kurtosis

Among-leaf variance/variation

Within-plant variance/variation

Among-plant

Within-population

Note these articles debating pro/con of standardizing terminology:


One side: We need to standardize!

The other side: it's really NBD:

Hodges, K.E. (2008), Defining the problem: terminology and progress in ecology. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, 6: 35-42. https://doi.org/10.1890/060108

This is an intersting alternative approach - it focuses on trying to standardize what should be reported in all papers (which can be a placve to introduce definitions).

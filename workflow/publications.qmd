# Writing Manuscripts {#sec-publications}

Manuscript Preparation using the github repository / template

## Reproducible Manuscripts

The same template for analyses can be used for creating a manuscript with Rmd


## Prior to Submission

[ ] Author Lists: Verify the Name, Institution, and OrcidID of all authors. If full lists of authors are not feasible (e.g., on oral presentation abstracts) or allowed by the journal, a short authorship list can be published with “The Members of the Herbivory Variability Network” as a coauthor, and a link to the full HerbVar author list. If possible, include the full author list in the supplement.

[ ] All HerbVar publications must include the following text in the Acknowledgements:

**Please use this text in the acknowledgments of HerbVar manuscripts:** "This work was generated using data from the HerbVar Network (https://herbvar.org/), which was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-2203582). 

> "This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant No. DEB-2203582)."

[ ] If the data set used in the manuscript has been archived in a repository, please cite both the data set archive and the original article in your paper section. For example, if using the Core Dataset archived at Dryad, your manuscript or presentation should include citations to both of the following: 

> Wetzel, William; Hahn, Philip; Inouye, Brian et al. (2023). Plant size, latitude, and phylogeny explain within-population variability in herbivory [Dataset]. Dryad. https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.44j0zpckm

> The Herbivory Variability Network (2023). Plant size, latitude, and phylogeny explain within-population variability in herbivory. _Science_ 382,679-683. DOI:10.1126/science.adh8830

[ ] Keywords: **Please use "HerbVar" as one of the keywords when submitting manuscripts.** This allows products using HerbVar to be more easily found when the articles are indexed in databases such as SCOPUS.


## Following Submission

[ ] Add the MS to the Zotero Group (Important for NSF reporting to know how many manuscripts are in review.)

[ ] Post a Preprint (optional but encouraged)

## Upon Acceptance

[ ] Update the record in the Zotero library

[ ] Archive any 'new' Data with Dryad
  
[ ] Include a citation of the 'new' data's Dryad archive in the accepted version of the manuscript in accordance with the journal's guidelines (e.g., in References, Data Availability Statement, etc.).  

[ ] Archive the Analysis Repo on Zenodo

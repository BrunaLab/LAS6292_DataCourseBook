# Workflow Overview {#sec-workflow}

HerbVar relies heavily on version control with Git/Github to facilitate data validation and management [@goodmanTenSimpleRules2014; @kimImplementingGitHubActions2022; @yenniDevelopingModernData2019], promote collaboration [@bolandTenSimpleRules2017; @bragaNotJustProgrammers2023], and streamline data access, analysis, and archiving [@champieuxTenSimpleRules2023]. Below we describe the workflow for (a) collecting data for HerbVar and uploading it for integration with the global data set and (b) analyzing some or all of the global HerbVar data set and preparing a manuscript based on these analyses.  


## Collecting new HerbVar Data

1. Review and Select Protocols
2. Collect Data
3. Create a repository for cleaning the data using the `new_dataset_template`.
4. Upload the clean version of the data using the portal

## New analysis with Herbvar Datasets

1. Identify Questions, Submit for Review to make sure no overlap
2. Create a repository for harvesting, organizing, and analyzing the data to be used in the analyses using the `new_analysis_and_paper_template`.
3. This template can also be used to write the manuscript in markdown using a template such as `papaja` or one of the 'rticles` templates.
